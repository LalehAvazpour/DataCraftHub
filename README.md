# DataCraftHub
Data engineering, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and machine learning projects. In this repository, I showcase my expertise in SQL, Python, ETL processes, and cutting-edge Machine Learning techniques. The inaugural project featured here is a compelling example of the synergy between ETL and deep learning:

Project: Customer Churn Prediction using ANN | Deep Learning
Uncover the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in predicting customer churn. This project not only delves into the intricacies of deep learning but also highlights the seamless integration of ETL processes. Witness the convergence of SQL, Python, and advanced machine learning to create a predictive model that can revolutionize how we understand and mitigate customer churn.
