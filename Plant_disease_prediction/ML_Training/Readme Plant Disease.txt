# Project: Plant Disease Detection Mobile App

## Objective:
Develop a mobile app that allows farmers to detect diseases in plants by capturing images. The app will utilize image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to provide real-time analysis of plant health.

## Technology Stack:

### Model Building:
- TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Specifically designed for image classification tasks.
- Data Augmentation: To artificially increase the diversity of the training dataset.
- TF Dataset: Efficient input pipeline for handling large-scale datasets.

### Backend Server and ML Ops:
- TF Serving: For serving the trained model as a REST API.
- FastAPI: A modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python.
- ML Ops: Ensuring smooth integration and operation of machine learning models in production.

### Model Optimization:
- Quantization: Reducing model size and improving inference speed.
- TensorFlow Lite: Optimized for mobile and edge devices, enabling efficient model deployment on mobile devices.

### Frontend:
- React JS: For building the web-based frontend.
- React Native: For developing the mobile app with a native look and feel.

### Deployment:
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud infrastructure for hosting and deploying the application.
- Google Cloud Functions (GCF): Serverless functions for event-driven execution, enhancing scalability.

## Workflow:

1. Data Collection:
   - Collect a diverse dataset of plant images, including healthy and diseased samples.

2. Model Development:
   - Use TensorFlow to create a CNN for plant disease classification.
   - Implement data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness.
   - Utilize TF Dataset for efficient handling of training data.

3. Backend Development:
   - Set up TF Serving to expose the trained model as a REST API.
   - Develop backend services using FastAPI for handling image requests and responses.

4. Model Optimization:
   - Apply quantization techniques to reduce model size.
   - Convert the model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.

5. Frontend Development:
   - Build a web-based frontend using React JS for easy accessibility.
   - Develop a mobile app with React Native for on-the-go plant disease detection.

6. Deployment:
   - Deploy the model on GCP using TF Serving.
   - Utilize GCF for serverless functions to enhance scalability.
   - Host the web-based frontend and mobile app on GCP.

7. User Interaction:
   - Farmers capture plant images using the mobile app.
   - The app sends images to the backend for analysis.
   - The model predicts whether the plant is healthy or diseased.
   - Results are displayed in real-time on the mobile app.

8. Continuous Improvement:
   - Monitor model performance and user feedback.
   - Iterate on the model and app based on feedback and emerging requirements.

This comprehensive technology stack ensures a seamless end-to-end solution for plant disease detection, combining powerful machine learning techniques with user-friendly interfaces for farmers.
